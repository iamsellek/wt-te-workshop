# Let's get started!

Before showing up to the workshop, go ahead and clone this repo, cd into it, and run an `npm install`. You'll need node and npm installed. If you don't have it installed, I highly recommend using `n` ([see here](https://github.com/tj/n#installation)) or `nvm` ([see here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)) to install node on your machine.
